# Week 9 Work

## FeildMaps
- Create and Test making a Feild map:
    - Old one: did not work, messed up sharing location and lisencing. https://fieldmaps.arcgis.app/?itemID=c4d212666d0f4c3cb7d5ece3d1e295b8&referenceContext=open&portalURL=https%3A%2F%2FFleming.maps.arcgis.com
    - New one: https://fieldmaps.arcgis.app/?itemID=0064db3d196b476ba7e4f304c2fcda42&referenceContext=open&portalURL=https%3A%2F%2FFleming.maps.arcgis.com
- Create a Form

- Benefits (noticed when builing the map):
  - Can add zones (geofences) to let workers know when enter or leave location
  - Can create offline map
    - And create a baseline offline map area to reduce downloading speeds of whole map

    - Click the little square with + button on offline manage area tab to designate the spot
    - When in app: needed to download offline area to use first 
  - Go through map settings and set best settings for this map.
    - Example: photo size
    - Can set map extent as well
    - Can be duplicated

- Cons:
  - I originally set up map with location settings on but did not realized I was not liscend for that and so the map would not open at first
