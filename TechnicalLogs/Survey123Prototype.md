# Create a New Survey 123 Survey to show as a prototype

## Building on old work:
- Using the work done in a previous week when testing out different things, we will be building a survey to show as a prototype for the college
- https://github.com/kaylaoneill/geom99/blob/main/Survey123.md

- Following the steps linked above:
- Pick a template: Incident Report

- Change questions to match what I am aiming for:

- Changes from last time:
  - Theme
  - Added a time
  - Took away Unsure as an "other"
  - Updated to ask user when survey is entered to use GPS
