# Create a New Survey 123 Survey to show as a prototype
## This is less a technical log but my thoughts and process when designing this survey

## Building on old work:
- Using the work done in a previous week when testing out different things, we will be building a survey to show as a prototype for the college
- https://github.com/kaylaoneill/geom99/blob/main/Survey123.md

- Following the steps linked above:
- Pick a template: Incident Report

- Change questions to match what I am aiming for:

- Changes from last time:
  - Theme
  - Added a time
  - Took away Unsure as an "other"
  - Updated to ask user when survey is entered to use GPS

## Thoughts I had when making it:
- What is the colors of the college? To match branding
- Wanted to keep it as low questions as possible to make it more appealing to answer
- Pre-select as much as possible: date, time, location
- Make questions a select when possible, as least typing as possible
- 
## Questions I still have / to ask the ground
- Do we do time and date as separate? What is the benefit of two questions vs it together in one
