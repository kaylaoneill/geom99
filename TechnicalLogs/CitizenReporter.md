  ## Overall Thoughts
  - Nice Dashboard, love the fact it showed requests by categories, would be helpful for a org that has multiple departments and such
  - Love the breakdown in the second tab of the dashboard
  - Reporter was easy to use
  - Took me a little to find how to assign tasks and mark as resolved and such - could be user error but more details would need to be provided here if used in a future project for training matetrials
