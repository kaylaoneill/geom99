## Notes
- Users need to have an account to be a user: expensive
- Would need to have someone maintaining users
- Easy to set up
- Can see all takss in one place and change how they are sorted. So you can change it to do all tasks in a zone you are in 
- Under the workers tab, you get  quick overview on how many tasks workers have assigned and who may need more support
